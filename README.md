# Cogsworth - A Multipurpose Discord Bot

Cogsworth is a multipurpose Discord bot built with Python and the `discord.py` library. It integrates with external APIs and manages server utilities, moderation, and persistent user data using SQLite.

This project is built modularly using the "Cogs" system to ensure clean and scalable code.
